# gifajster-driver

This is hardware driver for [Gifajster](https://github.com/dawiidio/qmk_firmware/tree/master/keyboards/gifajster)
a small media keyboard. Driver enables scrolling songs on Spotify by a physical knob available on keyboard 

For now supports only macOS 

I recommend running it as a service in background,
for example by [serviceman](https://webinstall.dev/serviceman/)
